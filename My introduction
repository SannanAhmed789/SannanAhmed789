- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sannan ahmed
- I am a 14 year old web developer and desginer, Game maker and 3d animator
- I started my journey in the March of 2022 when i started to learn HTML.
- HTML was my first ever language i had learned and over the past 2 years i have significantlly boosted my html skills with HTML i started to learn CSS.
- I started CSS almost 2 months after HTML and when i found out that CSS is a main language in website development.
- I learned HTML pretty fast CSS took a tiny bit longer then HTML but now i have learned a lot in CSS.
- After learning a good amount of these 2 languages i had made over 11 projects completely by coding.
- In June of 2023 i made my first app it was a food truck delivery app made in ADALO even though this wasnt coding i learned a lot on how to design a good app.                               
- In November of 2023 i got into Blender and it blew my mind i kept grinding and grinding animations day and night and after 3 to 4 months i had made over 6 different blender projects.
- On 5th december 2023 i started taking a freecodecamp course called 'Responsive Web Design' in the course i made 5 projects and i finished the whole course on 21st december after nearly 340 hours of coding.
- Now in january I started to learn python I made my first snake game but that was kinda easy ofcourse there were problems and errors but i made it and now i have created an A.I and its not that i used openai's API and gave chatgpt a voice no i made it all without a chatgpt API key ofcourse i used imports and different API keys like the weathers or news channels API keys but i have coded it by myself. Soon after i have made it better i will think of putting the code up here on GitHub.
- Finally after 2 years of learning and going to school with that and getting straight A's on my exams i have learned HTML,CSS a good amount of python, 3d designing, app designing and video editing and i personally can say thats pretty good for 2 years and im not stopping yet im gonna keep learning more and more until theres really nothing for me to learn.
- Thank you for reading.
